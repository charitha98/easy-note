# easy-note
Mobile application developed using flutter.

noNotesUI is not connected with the other pages. So it is not visible.

In the edit and the new pages the starred function is not working perfectly. So in the drawer menu favorites selection is not functioning.

In the search function there is a small error with the upper and lower case letters.
